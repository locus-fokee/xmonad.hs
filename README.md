# xmonad.hs
This is my xmonad.hs configuration file. I am making it private until I know how, when, why to do the stuff on github, about licenses, etc. but I would like if people us this file on their PCs. I am making a easy lightweight xmonad.hs config for a slow and old hardware, you know, it's mine.
I created this configuration file using code from the default xmonad.hs, using Derek Taylor's or DT's xmonad config and some parts of other people's code from the internet, from github also, etc. etc.
