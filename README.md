# xmonad.hs
This is my xmonad.hs configuration file. I am making it private until I know how, when, why to do the stuff on github, about licenses, etc. but I would like if people us this file on their PCs. I am making a easy lightweight xmonad.hs config for a slow and old hardware, you know, it's mine.
